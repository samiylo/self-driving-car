This is a Self Driving Simulation project which utilizes nural networks to learn.


### How to run this project...

##### Since this application is build using core Javascript, all you have to do is open the index html file in any browser, and use the arrow keys to control the vehicle.


This project is build from scratch using core Javascript functionality. The purpose of this project is to build basic but accurate vehicle physics, and to use a custom nural network to train the self driving car.
